This is two projects: a 3D Dice roller for Unity and a dice notation parser, written as pure C# - nothing about it requires unity. The parser could be ripped out (see the 'rollCodeParser' folder) and used elsewhere.

The goal is to be able to call for a dice roll, have it happen in whatever visually interesting way, and get back a result.
